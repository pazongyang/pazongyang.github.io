    <p class="first-section">Happy 21st Birthday my love! I'm so glad to be here with you and witness your growth for the past year. 
There may be days when you feel weary and lacking in energy, but just seeing you try to push through 
and help your family makes me very proud. As you return to school later on and spend most of the year there, miles away from familys and friends, 
please know that I'll be here, eagerly awaiting your return.  
May you stay safe and healthy, and goodluck on all of your future endeavors. Thank you for being here, love you always.</p>
    <p class="first-section">Sincerely,</p>

			  <p>One last thing before you finish. Time is going by so fast and I know it will continue that way, which makes me a little scare to see us grow older. I appreciate you so much
			  and everything you do. I don't find it embarrassing to tell you how grateful I am to have you because I would feel worst to have you not knowing how
			  great of a person you are. Except your temper hpmhmmh, we can work on that loll jk. I will do my best to understand you and support you my love.
			  Celebrate when you are proud and happy, communicate with me when you are down. Rest when you are tired and let me know when you want more love,
				  I will repeat i love you hundreds of times and they all will always be true <3 </p>
